# Projects from Hackathons
Welcome to the DIMFLIX-Hackathons organization, the place where I post my projects created at hackathons! Here you will find various ideas, prototypes and solutions that were developed during the hackathons, as well as useful resources for participants.

## About the project
The goal of this organization is to promote ideas and technologies created at hackathons. Here you will find resources and tools to help you develop, as well as finished projects that can be used as a basis or inspiration for your own ideas.

## How to use
You are free to browse my projects and repositories to get an idea of how you can implement ideas at hackathons. You can clone repositories with projects and solutions to speed up the process of developing your own ideas. If you find a project you like, you can use it as the basis for your own project (if the license allows you to do so).
